Hi stranger,

Unfortunately, you won't find anything particularly useful on this web
page and there is little reason to keep it alive but the temping ease of
adding a personal website input on job application forms and the
.works domain being on sale still keep it running.

If you reach this website, you already have my Linkedin and email, so
the only thing I can do for you here is to wish you a pleasant wonderful
day.

All best,
Viktor
